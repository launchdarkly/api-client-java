## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**treatmentId** | **String** | The ID of the treatment |  [optional] |
|**treatmentName** | **String** | The name of the treatment |  [optional] |
|**mean** | **BigDecimal** | The average value of the variation in this sample. It doesnâ€™t capture the uncertainty in the measurement, so it should not be the only measurement you use to make decisions. |  [optional] |
|**credibleInterval** | [**CredibleIntervalRep**](CredibleIntervalRep.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**pBest** | **BigDecimal** | The likelihood that this variation has the biggest effect on the primary metric. The variation with the highest probability is likely the best of the variations you&#39;re testing |  [optional] |
|**relativeDifferences** | [**List&lt;RelativeDifferenceRep&gt;**](RelativeDifferenceRep.md) | A list of the ranges of the metric that you should have 90% confidence in, for each treatment ID. For example, if the range of the relative differences is [-1%, 4%], you can have 90% confidence that the population difference is a number between 1% lower and 4% higher than the control. |  [optional] |
|**units** | **Long** | The number of end users in this variation of the experiment |  [optional] |
